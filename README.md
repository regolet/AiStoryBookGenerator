## Example Story Input

```
Title: The Brave Little Robot

Once upon a time, in a futuristic city filled with towering skyscrapers and neon lights, there lived a small robot named Beep. Beep had bright blue eyes that glowed in the dark and silver metallic body that sparkled under the city lights.

One day, Beep discovered that the city's main power source was failing. The giant crystal that powered everything was losing its glow. Beep knew he had to help.

Despite being the smallest robot in the city, Beep ventured into the dangerous underground tunnels. There, he found the problem - a massive tangle of broken cables.

Working through the night, Beep carefully repaired each cable with his tiny tools. As the sun rose, the crystal began to glow again, brighter than ever.

The city celebrated Beep as a hero, proving that even the smallest among us can make the biggest difference.
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure all API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
- Check the Settings tab in the web interface to verify API status
- Restart the server after adding API keys

### Image Generation Failures
- Check your Replicate account has sufficient credits
- Verify Google AI Studio API is enabled
- Try reducing image dimensions or inference steps

### Memory Issues
- Reduce the number of scenes by writing shorter stories
- Lower image resolution in advanced settings
- Process one story at a time
